        <h2>Hi, I'm Pratham </h2>
        <p>I am a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a strong passion for Information Technology and
            emerging technologies. I explore new tools, frameworks, and programming concepts daily to stay ahead in this
            fast-evolving field.

            My curiosity and commitment to continuous learning drive me to expand my technical skill set and work on
            projects that combine creativity with innovation. I’m eager to connect with industry professionals,
            contribute to impactful projects, and grow as an IT professional in the areas of Software development, AI,
            and ML.</p>
